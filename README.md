Node + Express backend and React.js frontend

The following instructions to run the project should be done in different terminal instances

# Backend

```
npm install
nodemon start
```

# Frontend

Some times npm start won't work, so the project can be run with the following terminal command:

```
node node_modules/react-scripts/scripts/start.js
```
